# EcoFlow

## Installation

Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

This will install all required packages for the frontend and backend applications.

## Running the Application

To run both frontend and backend concurrently in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start:
- Frontend development server
- Backend development server

Both services will run simultaneously and restart automatically when you make changes to the code.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to run frontend and backend separately:

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
